# display-sleeper
The simplest script possible to put the monitor in a Linux system to sleep

The work on this was inspired by a bug in Chrome/Brave that torments me for so long now:
When you play a video in the browser, then the system will never put the monitor to sleep, even if the video window is closed. The only remedy is to quit the browser.
The bug is discussed heavily in many places including: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=931235
There is no official remedy still.
